# Phase 5: OPTIMIZE

## Goal
Restructure the new skill for better agent experience and finalize.

## Steps

### 5.1 Add Decision Tree to SKILL.md
Ensure the new skill has a "What Reference Do I Need?" table at the top of its `SKILL.md`.

### 5.2 Merge Overlapping Files
If two reference files cover related content, merge them into a single, more comprehensive file and delete the old ones.

### 5.3 Rename Unclear Files
Use problem-oriented names (e.g., `schema-patterns.md` instead of `patterns.md`).

### 5.4 Slim SKILL.md
Target: <80 lines. Remove exhaustive link lists and redundant explanations. Keep only the essentials: quick setup, decision tree, and reference list.

### 5.5 Final Check
Verify:
- [ ] `SKILL.md` has a decision tree.
- [ ] `SKILL.md` is concise (<80 lines).
- [ ] Reference files are focused and have "When to Use" sections.
- [ ] No duplicate content.

### 5.6 Log Completion
Update `transfer-log.md`:

```markdown

## TRANSFER COMPLETE

## Output
